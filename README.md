## üöÄ Installation

3. Install the dependencies:

   mvn install
   
4. Visit https://twelvedata.com/docs to get your own api key. 

5. Also, you need to change environment variable for yourself. Before starting, create '.env' file and add your DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, EXTERNAL_API_KEY.

   ```
   DB_USER='Your database user'
   DB_PASSWORD='Your database password'
   DB_NAME='Your database name'
   EXTERNAL_API_KEY='Your api key'
   
6. Then you need to build docker image for the app. Use file 'build.bat'.

7. Now, you can use the app by starting docker-compose.yml file, which you can find in the main directory of the project (you must have Docker). 

## üíª Exploitation

1. You can start working with the app with docker-compose.yml file. Move to the project directory and call the command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d  
   
2. Use an application to send requests, for example, Postman.
   
   * GET: http://localhost:8081/transactions
   * GET: http://localhost:8081/transactions/limited
   * GET: http://localhost:8081/limits
   * POST: http://localhost:8081/transactions
   * POST: http://localhost:8081/limits

   P.S. You can find DTO schemes for POST requests in the project  structure.
